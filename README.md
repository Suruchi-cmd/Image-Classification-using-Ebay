# Image Classification Using eBay Dataset
This project focuses on classifying images into different product categories using a dataset scraped from eBay. The project is divided into two main parts: scraping the data and training a model using the scraped data.

## Dataset 
The data is scraped from ebay, and there are four categories of images that has been scraped:
girls apparel, womens shoes, boys apparel, mens shoes. 
These images are stored in imgDataSet/ , so they need not be scraped if you are only using the code to train the model.

## Pretrained model 
We have included the pretrained models in the models/ directory. These models were trained on the eBay dataset and can be used to classify new product images.
